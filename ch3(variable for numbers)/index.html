      <h1>Variable for Numbers</h1>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, a variable used to store numbers can hold both integers
        (like 5, 100, -42) and floating-point numbers (like 3.14, -0.5, 100.00).
        You can declare a number variable using let, const, or var. For example,
        let age = 25; creates a variable named age that stores the number 25.
        JavaScript uses the number data type for all numeric values, whether
        they are whole numbers or decimals. Unlike some programming languages,
        JavaScript does not have separate types for integers and floatsâ€”they are
        all considered type number. You can also perform mathematical operations
        such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on number
        variables using standard arithmetic operators. JavaScript also includes
        built-in functions like Math.round(), Math.floor(), and Math.random() to
        work with numbers more effectively.
