      <h1>Variable for strings</h1>
         <p>
        In JavaScript, a variable for a string is used to store a sequence of
        characters, such as words or sentences. You can declare a string
        variable using let, const, or var, followed by the variable name and an
        assignment using quotation marks. Strings can be enclosed in single
        quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or backticks (` `) for template
        literals. For example, let name = "John"; stores the string "John" in
        the variable name. Using template literals allows string interpolation,
        meaning you can embed variables directly within a string using ${}
        syntax, like `Hello, ${name}`. Strings in JavaScript are immutable,
        meaning their content cannot be changed once created, but you can create
        new strings by combining or manipulating them using built-in string
        methods such as .toUpperCase(), .slice(), .replace(), and .concat().
        JavaScript treats strings as objects, giving you access to a wide range
        of methods and properties to work with text data.
